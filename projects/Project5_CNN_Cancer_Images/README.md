# 🧬 Project 5 — Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for Breast Cancer Classification Using Histopathological Images

---

## 📌 Overview

This project develops a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify breast cancer histopathological images into malignant and benign categories.

Using approximately 8,000 microscopic images, the model learns spatial patterns in tissue morphology to perform automated cancer detection.

This project introduces deep learning for medical imaging, expanding beyond transcriptomic modeling into computer vision applications in translational oncology.

## 🎯 Objective

Build a binary image classifier to distinguish:

- Benign breast tissue
- Malignant breast cancer tissue

### Input
Histopathological microscopy images.

### Output
Binary classification label:
- 0 → Benign
- 1 → Malignant
