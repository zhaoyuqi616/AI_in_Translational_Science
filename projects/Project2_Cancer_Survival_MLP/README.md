# 🧬 Project 2 — Multilayer Perceptron for Breast Cancer Survival Prediction

## 📌 Overview

This project implements a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural network to predict 5-year survival outcomes in breast cancer patients using the Haberman Survival Dataset.

It demonstrates how neural networks can be applied to structured clinical data for prognostic modeling in translational oncology.

## 🎯 Objective

Predict whether a patient survived at least 5 years after breast cancer surgery using clinical features.

### Binary Classification Task

- 1 → Survived 5 years or longer  
- 0 → Died within 5 years
