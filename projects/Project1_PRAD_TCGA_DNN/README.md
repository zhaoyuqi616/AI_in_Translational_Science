# 🧬 Project 1 — Deep Learning-based Identification of Prostate Cancer Using TCGA RNA-seq

## 📌 Overview

This project implements a deep neural network (DNN) classifier to distinguish prostate cancer samples using bulk RNA-seq gene expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Prostate Adenocarcinoma (PRAD) cohort.

The goal is to demonstrate how deep learning can be applied to transcriptomic data for cancer classification in a translational research context.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Build a binary classifier that predicts:

- **Tumor (Primary solid tumor)**
- **Normal (Solid tissue normal)**

using gene expression features derived from TCGA RNA-seq data.

---

## 🧪 Dataset

- Source: TCGA PRAD
- Data Type: Bulk RNA-seq gene expression
- Features: ~577 genes (as defined in the input dataset)
- Labels:
  - `Primary solid Tumor`
  - `Solid Tissue Normal`

⚠️ **Note**: Raw patient-level data is not included in this repository.
Users must download TCGA PRAD expression data from:

- GDC Data Portal  
  https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/

## 🧠 Model Architecture

The classifier is implemented using TensorFlow / Keras.

### Neural Network Structure

- Input Layer: 577 features
- Dense Layer (256 units, ReLU)
- Dropout (0.5)

# 💡 Important Recommendation

Your current implementation is a **great learning start**, but if you want this project to impress biotech/AI hiring managers, I strongly recommend:

- Adding train/test split
- Adding AUROC
- Adding proper scaling
- Saving model weights instead of dill session
- Including a ROC curve image in README

If you'd like, I can next:

- 🔥 Rewrite the code into a “production-ready v2”
- 📊 Add ROC + confusion matrix figure
- 🧠 Add SHAP interpretability
- 🎯 Upgrade this to industry-grade quality

Just tell me the level you want:
- Learning project
- Industry portfolio
- Research-paper style
- Generative AI extension
